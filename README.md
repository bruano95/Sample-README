  ## DESCRIPTION
  ### This application creates an easier way for a baseball fanatic to view and understand statistics. The application uses third party API's that gather statistics from Major League Baseball. This application provides a link for each specific stat to help the user better understand the definition. The stats are then broken down by year and also gives filter options to view who is the best at a certain statistic.

  ## INSTALLATION
  ### In order to install this application the user must have a working device that has access to the internet. 

  ## USAGE
  ### The user opens the site and is able to search by statistic, player, or team. The user is then directed to a list within the desired category and provided with further filters to find what they are looking for. The user has the option to return to the main search page to restart the search.
